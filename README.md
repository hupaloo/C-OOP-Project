# C-plus-plus-OOP-Project
Project on the OOP is devoted to the issue of creating a hierarchy of classes, applying inheritance and polymorphism, developing storage container for the collection of objects created by the user. In the project class definitions were performed (hierarchy of program classes: base class – engine, derived classes – turbojet, combustion), user menu was designed, set of objects was created and its storage container was developed (type of container – circular doubly linked list), serialization of container data was done and container elements was created via deserialization of file data, data search in the container was performed (search query – total power of all engines of the given type).
